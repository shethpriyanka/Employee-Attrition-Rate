# Employee Attrition Rate

## Overview

This project showcases the design and implementation of an ETL pipeline using Azure Data Factory (ADF) for data extraction, transformation, and loading. It also demonstrates the use of Databricks for data transformation, Azure Synapse for SQL-based analysis, and Power BI for data visualization.

## Components

### 1. Azure Data Factory (ADF)

- **Data Ingestion**: ADF is used to ingest data from various sources such as databases, files, and streaming services.
- **Data Transformation**: ADF pipelines are designed to transform raw data into a format suitable for analysis.
- **Data Loading**: Transformed data is loaded into a destination for further processing or visualization.

### 2. Databricks

- **Data Transformation**: Databricks notebooks are used to perform complex transformations on the ingested data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Databricks provides a scalable environment for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.

### 3. Azure Synapse

- **SQL-Based Analysis**: Azure Synapse is utilized for SQL-based analysis of the transformed data.
- **Data Warehousing**: Synapse provides a data warehousing solution for storing and querying large datasets.

### 4. Power BI

- **Data Visualization**: Power BI is used to create interactive visualizations and dashboards based on the analyzed data.
- **Reporting**: Power BI reports provide insights into the data for stakeholders and decision-makers.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of designing and implementing an ETL pipeline using Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Azure Synapse, and Power BI. It highlights the importance of each component in the data processing workflow and showcases the capabilities of Azure's data services for modern data analytics.
